== README

This is a pin board that is similar to what to Pin Interest website. It allows users to sign up and sign in and post new pins with a title and description. This is a very basic app so it does not have any testing or validations on it.

The app makes use of:

* [Devise](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise)

* [Acts_as_votable](https://rubygems.org/gems/acts_as_votable/versions/0.10.0)

* [Paperclip](https://rubygems.org/gems/paperclip)

* [Masonry (for transitions)](https://rubygems.org/gems/masonry-rails)

* [Bootstrap-Sass](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass)

* [Rails Simple forms](https://rubygems.org/gems/simple_form)

* [Haml](https://rubygems.org/gems/haml)




Please feel free to clone and extend the functionalities
